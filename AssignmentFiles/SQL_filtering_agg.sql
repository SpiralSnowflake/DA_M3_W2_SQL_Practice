-- Q1) Compute total items per order.
--     Return (order_id, total_items) from order_items.

-- Q2) Compute total items per order for PAID orders only.
--     Return (order_id, total_items). Hint: order_id IN (SELECT ... FROM orders WHERE status='paid').

-- Q3) How many orders were placed per day (all statuses)?
--     Return (order_date, orders_count) from orders.

-- Q4) What is the average number of items per PAID order?
--     Use a subquery or CTE over order_items filtered by order_id IN (...).

-- Q10) Per store, list payment_method and the number of PAID orders.
--      Return (store_id, payment_method, paid_orders_count).
-- app 3/13
